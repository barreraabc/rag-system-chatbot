# Summary
This project involves the development of a RAG-based chatbot system.
The objectives may evolve over time, but broadly speaking, the aim is to build a system as close as possible to one that could be used in a production environment.
To achieve this, the system must be secure, robust, efficient, scalable, and easy to maintainâ€”adhering to the characteristics of a standard system.

Two repos will be created: one using the free tiers of paid tools commonly employed in professional (cloud) environments, and another using exclusively open-source software.
In addition, related repositories will be studied or created to analyse articles relevant to the system, special RAG techniques, prompting strategies, and more.

The project will include a task manager, a journal, and a technical report.
The journal should record all significant actions related to the project, as well as any information of interest, without being overly strict.
The technical report will be a document containing explanations about the system (architecture, tools, etc.), as well as article analyses, experiments, tests, statistics, and so on.
